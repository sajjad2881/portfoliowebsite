        <div class="text-2xl">I have divided this page into two main categories.
            <br><br> 1. <a href="hof.html" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-gray-700 underline">The Nerd Hall of Fame</a>
            <div class="text-xl py-6">
                This is a timeless curation of stuff that I find very interesting and could nerd about for hours and hours. If any of this interests you, please get in touch and I would love to talk more about it :)
            </div>
            <br> 2. <a href="interestingstuff.html" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-gray-700 underline">Interesting Stuff Encountered</a>
            <div class="text-xl py-6">Whenever I come across something interesting, I usually save it somewhere on my phone and laptop. Now, I have decided to put it on this page. I hope it can become a repository I come back to often, both to remind myself and to reminisce on how far I have come. <br>This is stuff I have picked from an ocean of content as some of the best. If you choose to read some of it, I also hope it can bring value to your life too!
