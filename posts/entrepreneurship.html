Why I Love Startups and Entrepreneurship 
</div>
<br>

Entrepreneurship has been the defining characteristic of my college experience so far. I have been involved with  <a href="https://www.alma.works" target="_blank" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-gray-700 underline"> Almaworks</a>, Columbia’s undergraduate run startup accelerator, for about three semesters, and am now director. In that time, I have had the incredible privilege to work with so many amazing ideas and companies and I have learnt so much. To me, the notion that you can create something tangible from just an idea in your head is just magical. And to create value for people in the world, and to impact someone’s life, and leave the world a slightly better place. <br> <br>

However, entrepreneurship isn’t just restricted to starting a company. I define it as a mindset: entrepreneurship means striving for progress and improvement everywhere. An entrepreneurial spirit is the main factor that drives positive change in the world. <br><br>

I am very passionated about improvement in the developing world. I was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan. Karachi faces hundreds of issues, each one causing more harm than the other. Growing up, I have been forced to think about so much — education, homelessness, sanitation, public transport, and the list goes on. Being able to just choose one social issue to care about is not a privilege I have had. However, my ideas always circle back to technology. I am bustling with solutions, and I am interested in learning how to use entrepreneurship to create sustainable, positive change. <br><br>

I care about entrepreneurship because it gives me a roadmap and toolkit of understanding myself and my world, and because it brings me hope. <br>
