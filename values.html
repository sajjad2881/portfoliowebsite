        <br>These are some of the traits I have come to value. I try my best embody these in my own work, and to seek environments where they are similarly valued. <br> <br>
        <div class="text-xl">
        1. Being Teachable - I am willing and eager to learn from those around me. People are so cool and learning has made me humble. I want to learn as much as I can from the people I interact with, both in terms of perspective and skills. There is always a better way to do something, and I want to learn that and improve my work. Additionally, I find myself willing to respectfully engage with differing viewpoints and correct myself when a better idea presents itself. <br><br>
        2. Being Approachable - I want to be someone anyone is comfortable talking to, regardless of whether I am leading a project or the newest memeber on the team. I have found being approachable increases transparency and trust, and improves the team dynamic and ultimately the quality of work. Stopping to help others always pays off. <br><br>
        3. Curiosity - I try to understand how things work, and why they work the way they do. This helps me make sense of the world, and apply my critical thinking to better understand how the world can be improved. Steve Jobs once said "Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it." I have been trying to internalise this powerful fact and combine it with my curiosity to develop a new way of looking at the world, and I have found it to be very powerful. For example, after learning that Python is written in C, I have started to look at the source code and understand how things are done and why those design choices were made. <br><br>
        4. Learning - This sentiment was inducted into the literary cannon by Socrates, and has been echoed ever since: the only true wisdom is knowing you know nothing. I have found this to be increasingly true the more I have learnt. However, while I have accepted this fact, I have come to another, more powerful realisation -- that I can generate the courage needed to think independently and teach myself anything that I need to know.
